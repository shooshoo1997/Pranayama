--- Material --- 
Spectrometer: OceanOptics USB2000+
Light source: OceanOptics HL-2000-FHSA
Fiber: EMvision 6 outerrings probe 1 inner probe (alex's probe)
Software: Opt-id (on windows)

--- Imaging Specs ---
ExposureTime: 50ms
IntegrationTime: 1000ms
Absolute Error: 5.00%

--- Goal ---
The goal of the experiment is to see what is the effect of distance between the sample and the fiber on the absorbtion spectra once it is normalize. Do you have to take a whiteref at the SAME distance that you use your samples if you don't care about absolute value of absorbance. 

--- Methods ---
- The white ref was taken on white paper. The image was acquired at an unknown distance but enough to get high signal (50 000 counts highest peak)
- The red, blue and yellow cardboard spectra were acquired. The images were acquired at 5 different unknown distance.
- All data were exported to CSV file.
