#Opt-ID - USB2000 Interface Software
This is a minimal UI for interfacing OceanOptics
Spectrometers using the ‘seaborn‘ package. It has been coded to
replace the old OceanView which was non-intuitive. If you go to
the _Release_ tab, you will find the latest build. It has been builded
for MacOS BigSur and Windows 10.

**Main Functionalities**
-
- Live spectrum visualisation @≥100Hz
- Set exposure and integration time
- Remove a static background signal
- Normalize the light source.
- Interactive cursor to take on-graph measurements
- Save data easily in .csv format
